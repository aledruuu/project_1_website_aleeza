    <p>
      Up until 1828, chocolate was only known as a drink and not as the solid bar we have today.
      A man named Casparus Van Houten created a machine called the Cocoa Press that could seperate the cocoa butter from its bean and the mass that was left inside the bean was turned into a powder.
      By now having cocoa in its powdered form, it became easier to make the chocolate drink and therefore more acsessable to the common people.
      His son named Coenraad  Van Houten created a prosess than made the powder more soluable in water and less bitter.
      Around this time period Van Houten was remixing the powder with cocoa butter and sugar to create a bar.
      Once the the Van Houten's patent on chocolate powder expired, others started to recreate the powder and create chocolate bars.
